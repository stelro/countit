# COUNTIT

**countit** is a open source project written in C++ mostly for Linux systems and Mac OS X!
with **countit** , you can count physical lines, comment lines, blank lines,
and characters of source code in any project! Its supports many programming languages!

Inspired from awesome Cloc, but instead countit is written with C++
and is much faster so far!

**countit** is still under development , and mostly its a experimental project
to sharpen my skills in C++!
